conda create --name my_env python=3
conda create --name py372 python=3.7.2
conda create -n my_env35 python=3.5

source activate my_env
source acitvate py372
conda activate py372
conda activate conda_env_gb_dj

conda deactivate
source deactivate

python --version


Note that you can replace the word source with . to achieve the same results.
You can update your version of Python along the same branch 
(as in updating Python 3.5.1 to Python 3.5.2) within a respective 
environment with the following command:
conda update python

conda info --envs



You can add additional packages, such as numpy for example, with the following command:

conda install --name my_env35 numpy
If you know you would like a numpy environment upon creation, you can target it in your conda create command:

conda create --name my_env python=3 numpy
If you are no longer working on a specific project and have no further need for the associated environment, you can remove it. To do so, type the following:

conda remove --name my_env35 --all
